*(see it's called Punishment bc it's bullying but like a hellish spin on that)*

## Features

  - designed for use with M2 screws screwed directly in

- Cherry-ish lip
- Box-on-wedge design

## Want one?

All relevant STL and STEP files are available, currently only with a blank blocker

Additional parts needed:
- Infernum [PCB and Plate](https://haizeuskb.bigcartel.com/product/infernum-pcb-only-group-buy)
- 4 M2x5(ish)mm screws. I used machine screws,self-tapping screws for plastic like [these](https://www.mcmaster.com/96817A207/) may also work
- 4 P3D/Aeternus feet

## QA Notes
- I haven't built this yet so I don't know if it works, talk to me in March 2024 
- They probably work! No promises though

TL;DR: Files are provided as is and I accept no liability if they aren't good

## Etc.
Use what's in this repository as you see fit, within reason. 

If you build one, shoot me some pics! I'm best contacted on Discord @Chronomap
